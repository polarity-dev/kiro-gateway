## 🚀 Enterprise / IdC Setup

**This repo is both the gateway and the setup kit for running Claude Code against it locally.**
Cloning it gets you everything you need to point Claude Code (and other AI coding tools) at your
Kiro subscription.

### 🤖 Easiest path: guided setup

If you have **Kiro IDE** or another AI coding assistant open in this repo, ask:

> *"Set up kiro-gateway and Claude Code for me."*

In Claude Code you can also run **`/setup-gateway`**. The setup uses the current
repository directory automatically and keeps setup, gateway startup, and
verification there. It uses another path only when you explicitly name one.

When safe event streaming is available, the agent runs one long-lived process:

```bash
./setup.sh -y --aws-profile company --agent-events
```

Its stdout contains only allowlisted `KIRO_EVENT` JSONL records, so the agent can
relay the code and URL in chat while that same process continues polling. Raw
setup/debug logs are never streamed. If safe monitoring is unavailable, enter
`! ./setup.sh -y --aws-profile company` directly at the Claude Code prompt. In a
normal terminal, use the same command without `!`.

`-y` accepts local installer confirmations only; it does **not** bypass AWS
approval. Keep the command running. It prints a `Code:` and `URL:` before opening
the browser and before polling. Compare the browser code with the terminal code
character-for-character, including case and hyphens, and choose **Confirm and
continue** only when they match exactly and you initiated the request. If the
code differs, is missing, or the request is unexpected, cancel it, press Ctrl+C,
and rerun setup for a fresh code. Never reuse a code from an interrupted,
denied, or expired attempt.

Add `--no-browser` to open the printed URL manually, `--q-profile NAME_OR_ARN`
when multiple Q profiles are assigned, or `--port PORT` for a custom first-setup
port. Wait for setup to exit successfully before starting the gateway:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

At startup, an expired access token is refreshed silently. If the direct IdC
refresh token or client registration is no longer usable, a local foreground
`python3 main.py` starts one device-authorization flow and then continues only
after successful approval. It never loops or silently changes Q profiles.
Docker, CI, direct `uvicorn main:app`, non-TTY services, SQLite/Kiro CLI, and
multi-account mode never open a browser; renew credentials separately in those
contexts. Use `python3 main.py --no-interactive-reauth` to disable startup device
login explicitly. Agents may use `--agent-events` to stream only safe startup
authentication events.

The full agent contract and troubleshooting flow live in
[`.kiro/steering/setup.md`](.kiro/steering/setup.md), referenced from
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

### 🛠️ Manual path

**AWS IAM Identity Center users can bootstrap the gateway without Kiro IDE or
Kiro CLI.** Configure an AWS shared-config profile with `sso_start_url` and
`sso_region` (directly or through `sso_session`), then use the normal-terminal
command above. Keep it in the foreground and apply the same exact-code check.

### What setup.sh does

With `--aws-profile`, setup registers a public AWS SSO OIDC client, completes
device authorization, discovers the assigned Amazon Q Developer profile through
bearer-authenticated `ListAvailableProfiles`, and writes refreshable owner-only
(`0600`) credentials to `~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-gateway-auth.json`. It stores the
SSO and Q API regions separately, generates `.env`, and atomically synchronizes
Claude Code and the selected gateway port.

Running without `--aws-profile` preserves the legacy Kiro IDE credential/log
path. Existing credential and `.env` files are never replaced without
confirmation; `.env` is backed up first.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- an AWS shared-config IAM Identity Center profile
- an assigned Amazon Q Developer subscription/profile
- Claude Code

### Troubleshooting

**Code is not visible while the browser waits** — cancel the request and stop
the command; never reuse that code. Agents should rerun with `--agent-events`
through safe event monitoring. Without it, use a visible foreground shell
(`! ./setup.sh ...` inside Claude Code; no `!` in a normal terminal).

**Repeated `401 Invalid API key` from the local gateway** — setup and the running
gateway may be using different checkouts, each with its own `.env` proxy key.
This is a local Claude-to-gateway mismatch, not an expired IAM Identity Center
token. Stop the gateway, return to the repository directory where setup was
run, rerun setup/alignment there, restart from that same path, and open a new
Claude Code session. **Do not delete `kiro-gateway-auth.json`** to fix a local 401.

**Browser does not open** — rerun with `--no-browser`, open the printed URL, and
approve only if its code exactly matches the terminal `Code:`.

**Code differs, was denied, or expired** — cancel/stop the attempt and rerun
setup for a fresh code.

**No Q Developer profiles** — ask the AWS administrator to assign the
subscription/profile and retry after propagation.

**Multiple Q Developer profiles** — rerun with `--q-profile NAME_OR_ARN`.

**`runtime.<region>.kiro.dev` does not resolve** — configure `VPN_PROXY_URL` in
`.env`.

**Claude Code asks for a Claude account login** — this is different from the
expected AWS IAM Identity Center approval page. Rerun setup; it configures
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, not `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### Shell helper (optional)

`setup.sh` writes the Claude Code configuration to `~/.claude/settings.json`, so `claude` works
from any terminal without exporting anything. The only recurring task is starting the gateway.

Add this to `~/.zshrc` to avoid typing the path each time:

```bash
# Kiro Gateway
kiro-gateway() {
  local gw_dir="$HOME/repo/kiro-gateway"   # adjust to your clone location
  (cd "$gw_dir" && python3 main.py)
}
```

Then `kiro-gateway` starts it in the foreground; stop it with Ctrl+C. Do not add
`--port` or a `SERVER_PORT=...` assignment to the helper: `main.py` reads the
persisted port from this checkout's `.env`, so the helper automatically follows
future port changes.

### Choosing or changing the gateway port

`.env` is the persisted source of truth for the gateway port. The installer uses
the same value for the server runtime and Claude Code's `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.

For a first setup on a custom port:

```bash
./setup.sh -y --aws-profile NAME --port 9000
```

To change the port after setup is already complete:

```bash
./setup.sh --port 9100
```

The existing-installation path changes only `SERVER_PORT` and the managed Claude
Code connection values. It reuses the current proxy token, preserves unrelated
Claude settings, and backs up `.env` to `.env.bak`.

Complete this checklist one step at a time:

1. Run `./setup.sh --port <new-port>` and resolve any reported zsh helper drift.
2. Stop the running gateway with Ctrl+C.
3. Start it again with `python3 main.py` or the port-neutral `kiro-gateway` helper.
4. Open a new Claude Code session so it reloads `~/.claude/settings.json`.
5. Run `./setup.sh --check-port`; it must report the runtime, Claude Code, and
   optional zsh helper as aligned.

Do not use `python3 main.py --port N` for a persistent change: that is a transient
runtime override and cannot update Claude Code. Also remove any exported
`SERVER_PORT` from the launching shell (`unset SERVER_PORT`), because shell
environment variables override `.env`.

> **Why no `export` lines?** Environment variables do not cross terminal sessions, so exporting
> them in the window running the gateway would not reach the window running `claude`. Putting them
> in `~/.claude/settings.json` avoids the problem and also reaches Claude Code's background
> agents, which shell exports do not.

If you prefer environment variables over the settings file, export these instead — but note they
apply only to the shell you set them in:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:$(python3 scripts/manage_gateway_port.py resolve)"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="<your PROXY_API_KEY from .env>"
```

### Selecting a model

Model discovery is enabled by `setup.sh`, so `/model` inside Claude Code lists the models your
subscription grants, labelled `From gateway`. To inspect them directly:

```bash
PORT=$(python3 scripts/manage_gateway_port.py resolve)
curl -s "localhost:$PORT/v1/models" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print('\n'.join(m['id'] for m in json.load(sys.stdin)['data']))"
```

The synchronizer selects Kiro's `auto` router and maps Claude Code's virtual
**Default** row to **Kiro Auto**. Haiku remains separately selectable through its
explicit gateway row. Choose any other persistent model with `/model` or the
top-level `model` setting. Do not set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`: it has higher precedence
and overrides the saved picker choice. When Kiro adds or removes models, refresh
the static local allowlist with:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_claude_models.py sync
```

Use `--check` to detect drift without writing. The user-level allowlist is local
configuration, not an administrative policy boundary.

---

## 🔧 Fork Changes

Changes in this fork that are not yet in upstream:

**`setup.sh`** — Automated installer for Enterprise / IdC accounts, described above.

**Support for `role: "system"` in the Anthropic endpoint** — Claude Code sends the system prompt
as a message inside the `messages` array, while the Anthropic API specifies it as a separate
top-level `system` field. Upstream rejects these requests with an HTTP 422 validation error.
This fork accepts them:

- `kiro/models_anthropic.py` — `AnthropicMessage.role` accepts `"system"` alongside
  `"user"` and `"assistant"`
- `kiro/converters_anthropic.py` — `build_kiro_payload_anthropic()` filters system messages out
  of the array and merges their text into the system prompt before building the Kiro payload

> **Note:** this change currently covers the Anthropic endpoint only. Upstream's contribution
> guidelines require feature parity across both the OpenAI and Anthropic surfaces plus test
> coverage for streaming and non-streaming paths, so it is not yet suitable for a pull request.

### Syncing with upstream

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Expect conflicts in `kiro/models_anthropic.py` and `kiro/converters_anthropic.py`, since both
carry fork-specific changes.

---

## 🤖 Available Models

Model availability is discovered from Kiro for the authenticated subscription and
region; this repository intentionally contains no authoritative static model list.
Inspect the current gateway catalog with authenticated `GET /v1/models`, or run
`python3 scripts/sync_claude_models.py sync` to refresh Claude Code's picker.

Non-Claude Kiro IDs are exposed through reversible `claude-kiro-<length>-...`
rows, then decoded back to their raw Kiro `modelId` before inference.

## 🚀 Legacy / Advanced Credential Setup

> **IAM Identity Center users:** prefer the automated [Enterprise / IdC Setup](#-enterprise--idc-setup)
> above. The methods below reuse credentials managed by Kiro IDE/Kiro CLI or
> configure credential sources manually; they are retained for compatibility.

**Choose your deployment method:**
- 🐍 **Native Python** - Full control, easy debugging
- 🐳 **Docker** - Isolated environment, easy deployment → [jump to Docker](#-docker-deployment)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- One of the following:
  - [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/) with logged in account, OR
  - [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/cli/) with AWS SSO (AWS IAM Identity Center, OIDC) - free Builder ID or corporate account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (requires Git)
git clone https://github.com/Jwadow/kiro-gateway.git
cd kiro-gateway

# Or download ZIP: Code → Download ZIP → extract → open kiro-gateway folder

# Copy and edit .env with your credentials

# Start the server
python main.py

# Or with custom port (if 4567 is busy)
python main.py --port 9000
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:4567`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

> 💡 **Advanced users:** Looking for multi-account support? See [Account System](#-account-system-advanced) below.

### Option 1: JSON Credentials File (Kiro IDE / Enterprise)

Specify the path to the credentials file:

Works with:
- **Kiro IDE** (standard) - for personal accounts
- **Enterprise** - for corporate accounts with SSO

```env
KIRO_CREDS_FILE="~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server (make up any secure string)
# You'll use this as api_key when connecting to your gateway
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"
```

<details>
<summary>📄 JSON file format</summary>

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJ...",
  "expiresAt": "2025-01-12T23:00:00.000Z",
  "profileArn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:...",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "clientIdHash": "abc123..."  // Optional: for corporate SSO setups
}
```

> **Note:** If you have two JSON files in `~/.aws/sso/cache/` (e.g., `kiro-auth-token.json` and a file with a hash name), use `kiro-auth-token.json` in `KIRO_CREDS_FILE`. The gateway will automatically load the other file.

</details>

### Option 2: Environment Variables (.env file)

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required
REFRESH_TOKEN="your_kiro_refresh_token"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server (make up any secure string)
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Optional
PROFILE_ARN="arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:..."
KIRO_REGION="us-east-1"
```

### Option 3: AWS SSO Credentials (kiro-cli / Enterprise)

If you use `kiro-cli` or Kiro IDE with AWS SSO (AWS IAM Identity Center), the gateway will automatically detect and use the appropriate authentication.

Works with both free Builder ID accounts and corporate accounts.

```env
KIRO_CREDS_FILE="~/.aws/sso/cache/your-sso-cache-file.json"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Enterprise Amazon Q requests require a profile ARN.
# Direct bootstrap discovers it automatically. For legacy credential sources
# that omit it, set PROFILE_ARN manually. Builder ID may work without one.
```

<details>
<summary>📄 AWS SSO JSON file format</summary>

AWS SSO credentials files (from `~/.aws/sso/cache/`) contain:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJ...",
  "expiresAt": "2025-01-12T23:00:00.000Z",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "clientId": "...",
  "clientSecret": "..."
}
```

**Note:** Direct IAM Identity Center bootstrap discovers and stores `profileArn` automatically. Enterprise Amazon Q requests require it; legacy AWS SSO credential sources that omit it must provide `PROFILE_ARN` separately. Builder ID accounts may work without an Enterprise profile ARN.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 How it works</summary>

The gateway automatically detects the authentication type based on the credentials file:

- **Kiro Desktop Auth** (default): Used when `clientId` and `clientSecret` are NOT present
  - Endpoint: `https://prod.{region}.auth.desktop.kiro.dev/refreshToken`
  
- **AWS SSO (OIDC)**: Used when `clientId` and `clientSecret` ARE present
  - Endpoint: `https://oidc.{region}.amazonaws.com/token`

No additional configuration is needed — just point to your credentials file!

</details>

### Option 4: kiro-cli SQLite Database

If you use `kiro-cli` and prefer to use its SQLite database directly:

```env
KIRO_CLI_DB_FILE="~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Enterprise Amazon Q requests require a profile ARN.
# Direct bootstrap discovers it automatically. For legacy credential sources
# that omit it, set PROFILE_ARN manually. Builder ID may work without one.
```

<details>
<summary>📄 Database locations</summary>

| CLI Tool | Database Path |
|----------|---------------|
| kiro-cli | `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` |
| amazon-q-developer-cli | `~/.local/share/amazon-q/data.sqlite3` |

The gateway reads credentials from the `auth_kv` table which stores:
- `kirocli:odic:token` or `codewhisperer:odic:token` — access token, refresh token, expiration
- `kirocli:odic:device-registration` or `codewhisperer:odic:device-registration` — client ID and secret

Both key formats are supported for compatibility with different kiro-cli versions.

</details>

### Getting Credentials

**For Kiro IDE users:**
- Log in to Kiro IDE and use Option 1 above (JSON credentials file)
- The credentials file is created automatically after login

**For Kiro CLI users:**
- Log in with `kiro-cli login` and use Option 3 or Option 4 above
- No manual token extraction needed!

<details>
<summary>🔧 Advanced: Manual token extraction</summary>

If you need to manually extract the refresh token (e.g., for debugging), you can intercept Kiro IDE traffic:
- Look for requests to: `prod.us-east-1.auth.desktop.kiro.dev/refreshToken`

</details>

---

## 🔀 Account System (Advanced)

Account System is a way to manage multiple Kiro accounts with automatic failover. In the future, this system will replace `.env` file for credential configuration, but currently it's optional and intended for those who want to use multiple accounts.

### Why You Need This

If you have multiple Kiro accounts, the gateway can automatically switch between them when account is temporarily unavailable.

The system works with a single account too — just without switching.

### How to Enable

Add to your `.env`:

```env
ACCOUNT_SYSTEM=true
```

**What happens:**
- On first startup, your credentials from `.env` are automatically migrated to `credentials.json` (one-time)
- After that, all account and region settings from `.env` are ignored
- Account management only through `credentials.json`

<details>
<summary>📄 Configuration Examples</summary>

**Single account:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "json",
    "path": "~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"
  }
]
```

**Multiple accounts:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "json",
    "path": "~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"
  },
  {
    "type": "sqlite",
    "path": "~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3"
  },
  {
    "type": "refresh_token",
    "refresh_token": "eyJhbGc...",
    "profile_arn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:..."
  }
]
```

**Folder with files:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "json",
    "path": "C:\\MyAccs\\kiro67"
  }
]
```

The gateway will scan all files in the folder and add them as separate accounts.

</details>

### How Failover Works

When one account returns an error (429 rate limit, 402 quota exceeded), the gateway automatically tries the next account from the list. If an account fails several times in a row, the gateway temporarily stops using it and periodically checks if it has recovered.

For a single account, failover doesn't work — you get the original error from Kiro API.

For complete configuration examples (including per-account region settings), see [`credentials.json.example`](credentials.json.example).

## 🌐 VPN/Proxy Support

**For users in China, corporate networks, or regions with connectivity issues to AWS services.**

The gateway supports routing all Kiro API requests through a VPN or proxy server. This is essential if you experience connection problems to AWS endpoints or need to use a corporate proxy.

### Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# HTTP proxy
VPN_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7890

# SOCKS5 proxy
VPN_PROXY_URL=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080

# With authentication (corporate proxies)
VPN_PROXY_URL=http://username:password@proxy.company.com:8080

# Without protocol (defaults to http://)
VPN_PROXY_URL=192.168.1.100:8080
```

### Supported Protocols

- ✅ **HTTP** — Standard proxy protocol
- ✅ **HTTPS** — Secure proxy connections
- ✅ **SOCKS5** — Advanced proxy protocol (common in VPN software)
- ✅ **Authentication** — Username/password embedded in URL

### When You Need This

| Situation | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Connection timeouts to AWS | Use VPN/proxy to route traffic |
| Corporate network restrictions | Configure your company's proxy |
| Regional connectivity issues | Use a VPN service with proxy support |
| Privacy requirements | Route through your own proxy server |

### Popular VPN Software with Proxy Support

Most VPN clients provide a local proxy server you can use:
- **Sing-box** — Modern VPN client with HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy
- **Clash** — Usually runs on `http://127.0.0.1:7890`
- **V2Ray** — Configurable SOCKS5/HTTP proxy
- **Shadowsocks** — SOCKS5 proxy support
- **Corporate VPN** — Check your IT department for proxy settings

Leave `VPN_PROXY_URL` empty (default) if you don't need proxy support.

## 🔧 Debugging

Debug logging is **disabled by default**. To enable, add to your `.env`:

```env
# Debug logging mode:
# - off: disabled (default)
# - errors: save logs only for failed requests (4xx, 5xx) - recommended for troubleshooting
# - all: save logs for every request (overwrites on each request)
DEBUG_MODE=errors
```

### Debug Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `off` | Disabled (default) | Production |
| `errors` | Save logs only for failed requests (4xx, 5xx) | **Recommended for troubleshooting** |
| `all` | Save logs for every request | Development/debugging |

### Debug Files

When enabled, requests are logged to the `debug_logs/` folder:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `request_body.json` | Incoming request from client (OpenAI format) |
| `kiro_request_body.json` | Request sent to Kiro API |
| `response_stream_raw.txt` | Raw stream from Kiro |
| `response_stream_modified.txt` | Transformed stream (OpenAI format) |
| `app_logs.txt` | Application logs for the request |
| `error_info.json` | Error details (only on errors) |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Error: "Name or service not known" or DNS resolution failed**

The Q API endpoint may not be publicly resolvable in your region. Use a VPN or proxy:

```env
VPN_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7890
```

See [VPN/Proxy Support](#-vpnproxy-support) for details.

---

**Error: "503 Service Unavailable" through proxy**

The Q API endpoint exists in specific regions only. Try a different region:

```env
KIRO_API_REGION="eu-central-1"  # or us-east-1
```

Commonly reachable regions: `us-east-1`, `eu-central-1`

---

**OIDC works but Q API fails**

Your SSO region may differ from the Q API region. The gateway auto-detects this from credentials, but you can override:

```env
KIRO_API_REGION="eu-central-1"
```
